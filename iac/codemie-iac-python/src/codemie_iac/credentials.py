# known, closed set of reference sources means an arbitrary literal cannot
# coincidentally satisfy the reference shape; "env" is the only source this

# identifiers that differ only in punctuation collapse to the same output --
# see test_from_entity_sanitizes_non_alphanumeric), so two genuinely distinct
# (identifier, credential_key) pairs can collide onto the same CredentialRef
# string. The information needed to detect that (the original, pre-sanitized
# pair) only exists at the moment `from_entity` is called -- once a Bundle
# holds the final ref string, that provenance is gone. This process-lifetime
# registry remembers which pair produced which ref string, and raises if a
# *different* pair ever produces one already claimed by another pair. Calling
# `from_entity` again with the exact same pair (determinism, AC8) is not a
# collision and never raises.
